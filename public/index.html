      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h3>How react works?</h3>
    <p><b>Ans:</b> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces that is declarative, efficient, and
      flexible.
      React employs a declarative paradigm that facilitates reasoning about ones application and strives to be both
      efficient and flexible. A group of Facebook developers discovered that the DOM is slow while developing
      client-side apps. To speed things up, React implements a virtual DOM, which is essentially a DOM tree
      representation in JavaScript. As a result, when it needs to read or write to the DOM, it will use its virtual
      representation. The virtual DOM will then attempt to find the most efficient method of updating the browser's DOM.
      React elements, unlike browser DOM elements, are simple objects that are inexpensive to create. The DOM is updated
      to match the React elements by React DOM. The reason for this is that JavaScript is extremely fast, and it is
      worthwhile to keep a DOM tree in it to speed up its manipulation.
      Although React was designed to be used in the browser, its design allows it to be used in the server with Node.js.

    <h3>How useState works?</h3>
    <p><b>Ans: </b>We can use State Hook to track state in a function component. In general, state refers to data or
      properties that must be tracked in an application. The useStateÂ is a Hook. To add some local state to a function
      component, we call it from within it. This state will be preserved between re-renders by React. useState returns a
      pair consisting of the current state value and a function that can be used to update it. This function can be
      called from an event handler or anywhere else. It's comparable to this.setState in a class, but it does not merge
      the old and new states. You pass the initial state to this function, and it returns a variable containing the
      current state value (which may or may not be the initial state) and another function to update this value.</p>
